1. Set Up MySQL Database
Install MySQL: Download and install MySQL from MySQL’s official website, if it's not already installed.
Create a Database:
Open MySQL Workbench or the MySQL Command Line Client.
Log in to MySQL and create a new database using the command:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE online_blood_bank;
Create Necessary Tables:
Create the required tables (e.g., users, donations, etc.).
Insert Sample Data: Insert sample records in your tables (e.g., users for login functionality).
2. Install MySQL JDBC Driver
Download the MySQL Connector/J (JDBC Driver) from MySQL Connector/J.
Extract the .jar file from the download.
In Eclipse, right-click on your project → Build Path → Configure Build Path.
In the Libraries tab, click Add External JARs and add the MySQL JDBC .jar file you downloaded.
Click OK to add the JAR to your project.
3. Write Database Connection Code
Establish a Connection to MySQL:
Use JDBC to establish a connection between your Java code and the MySQL database.
Use the correct MySQL URL, username, and password in your connection setup.
4. Modify Java Code for Database Operations
Login Authentication:
Modify your LoginPage.java or equivalent to check user credentials against the MySQL database.
Ensure that the necessary SQL queries are executed to validate users.
Other Features:
Depending on the project, create additional methods to interact with your tables (e.g., donation records).
5. Run the Project in Eclipse
Clean and Build the project in Eclipse to make sure everything is compiled properly.
Run the project by clicking the green Run button in Eclipse.
Ensure that your MySQL server is running on your machine when you run the project.
6. Test Database Operations
Verify Database Connectivity: Test whether the system connects successfully to the database by checking if user login works correctly and if records can be retrieved or inserted into the database.
If any error occurs, make sure the database credentials and connection URL are correct.
7. Handling Errors
Handle any database connection errors by ensuring that your MySQL server is running.
Handle SQL exceptions (e.g., invalid credentials, database not reachable) by displaying appropriate error messages in the UI.
8. Commit Project to GitHub (Optional)
Initialize a Git repository for your project if not already done.
Commit and push your project to GitHub for version control.
9. Final Testing
Test all functionalities such as login, donation tracking, and other features to ensure everything is working as expected with MySQL as the backend.
